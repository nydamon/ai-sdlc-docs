# Cline Rules for The Credit Pros AI-SDLC Framework
# Enterprise Configuration for Credit Repair Compliance

## Core Development Rules

### Always Generate Tests
- Write comprehensive tests for any new code created
- Use Vitest for React/TypeScript/JavaScript, PHPUnit for Laravel/PHP
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage for all new features
- Run tests after generation and fix until all pass
- Include edge cases, error handling, and security validation

### Credit Repair Domain Compliance
- All credit data access must include audit trail logging
- Validate FCRA Section 604 permissible purpose for credit pulls  
- Encrypt PII data in tests using mock/encrypted values
- Include dispute resolution workflow validation in E2E tests
- Test credit score calculations with 300-850 FICO range validation

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow existing project conventions (detect from codebase)
- Use TypeScript strict mode for React components
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Add accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) compliance checks
- Include responsive design testing for mobile/desktop

### Testing Patterns
- Unit tests: Use Vitest for business logic and edge cases
- Integration tests: Test API endpoints with Vitest and mock data
- E2E tests: Test complete user workflows with Playwright
- Security tests: Validate authentication, authorization, data protection
- Performance tests: Check for memory leaks and response times

## TCP-Specific Requirements

### FCRA Compliance Testing
```typescript
// Required test pattern for credit data access
describe('FCRA Compliance', () => {
  it('should log audit trail for credit data access', () => {
    // Test audit logging
  });
  
  it('should verify permissible purpose before credit pull', () => {
    // Test Section 604 compliance
  });
  
  it('should encrypt PII data in transit and at rest', () => {
    // Test encryption validation
  });
});
```

### Credit Score Validation
```typescript
// Required test pattern for credit calculations  
describe('Credit Score Calculations', () => {
  it('should enforce 300-850 FICO score range', () => {
    expect(calculateScore(data)).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(300);
    expect(calculateScore(data)).toBeLessThanOrEqual(850);
  });
  
  it('should handle invalid input gracefully', () => {
    expect(() => calculateScore(null)).toThrow('Invalid credit data');
  });
});
```

### Database Testing
```php
// Required pattern for Laravel database tests
class CreditReportTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;
    
    /** @test */
    public function it_logs_audit_trail_for_credit_access()
    {
        // Test audit trail creation
        $this->assertDatabaseHas('audit_logs', [
            'action' => 'credit_report_access',
            'user_id' => $user->id
        ]);
    }
}
```

## File Handling Rules

### Never Modify These Files
- .env (contains sensitive API keys)
- package-lock.json, composer.lock
- .git/ directory and git hooks
- node_modules/, vendor/ directories
- Database migration files (unless explicitly requested)

### Always Check These Patterns
- Verify imports/requires are correct
- Check that test files have proper describe/test structure  
- Ensure async functions are properly awaited
- Validate that mocks are set up before tests run
- Check that database tests use RefreshDatabase trait

### Security Considerations
- Never commit real API keys or production credentials
- Use factory/seed data for testing, never production data
- Encrypt sensitive test data using Test::encrypt() patterns
- Validate that PII is properly masked in logs and outputs

## Code Generation Preferences

### React/TypeScript Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces/types
- Add data-testid attributes for E2E testing  
- Include loading and error states
- Follow existing styling patterns (detect from project)

### Laravel/PHP Backend
- Use proper request validation classes
- Include authorization checks (policies/gates)
- Add comprehensive API resource formatting
- Use service classes for complex business logic
- Include proper exception handling

### Test Generation Priority
1. Critical business logic (credit calculations, compliance)
2. User-facing features (components, forms, workflows)
3. API endpoints (authentication, data validation)
4. Database operations (CRUD, relationships)  
5. Integration points (external APIs, webhooks)

## Quality Gates

### Before Creating Tests
- Analyze the source code structure and purpose
- Identify the framework and testing conventions used
- Check for existing test patterns to follow
- Determine the appropriate test types needed (unit/integration/E2E)

### After Generating Tests  
- Run the tests and ensure they pass
- Check code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- Validate that tests cover edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on external services
- Verify compliance patterns are included where applicable

### Continuous Improvement
- Learn from existing test patterns in the codebase
- Adapt to project-specific conventions and structures
- Optimize test performance and reliability  
- Maintain consistency with team coding standards

## Integration with Existing AI-SDLC Framework

### Leverage Existing Automation
- Use npm run ai:generate-tests for batch test generation
- Work with existing Vitest/Playwright configurations
- Utilize the real-ai-test-generator.js for OpenAI integration
- Maintain compatibility with current git hooks and CI/CD

### Enhance Current Capabilities  
- Add interactive debugging and test refinement
- Provide real-time feedback during development
- Offer intelligent suggestions for test improvement
- Help with complex multi-file test scenarios

This configuration ensures Cline enhances the existing AI-SDLC framework while maintaining enterprise compliance and code quality standards specific to The Credit Pros' credit repair domain.
